Four. Riding close together, bunched-up like, and righteous. He was going to tell him that, because he
thought it was important: why he and Baby Suggs both missed it. And about the party too, because that
explained why nobody ran on ahead; why nobody sent a fleet-footed son to cut ’cross a field soon as they
saw the four horses in town hitched for watering while the riders asked questions. Not Ella, not John, not
anybody ran down or to Bluestone Road, to say some new whitefolks with the Look just rode in. The
righteous Look every Negro learned to recognize along with his ma’am’s tit. Like a flag hoisted, this
righteousness telegraphed and announced the faggot, the whip, the fist, the lie, long before it went public.
Nobody warned them, and he’d always believed it wasn’t the exhaustion from a long day’s gorging that
dulled them, but some other thing—like, well, like meanness—that let them stand aside, or not pay
attention, or tell themselves somebody else was probably bearing the news already to the house on
Bluestone Road where a pretty woman had been living for almost a month.`
